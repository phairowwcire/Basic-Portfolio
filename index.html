            <h3>--My journey from coding Padawan to coding Jedi Master--</p>
            </h3>


            Art was a passion...it's still in there somewhere. I graduated from Bowie State University with a
            Fine/Visual arts degree. Fast-forward several years later and I'm embarking on a new journey to become a
            Full Stack Web Developer.<br>
            Admittedly and unfortunately, I was one of those people that never knew what
            they wanted to be, or what their purpose was. It's of course never too late, and after many years of
            researching
            and trying different fields that I later determined I had little interest in or didn't suit my personality,
            etc.
            My father came across information for a coding bootcamp. <br>
            I thought back to (yes this ages me *laughs*)
            MySpace days. opening the code template and messing about in it. Trial and error, changing things...and it
            came to me, combine back end with front end. Coding structure with front end design aided by my past art
            passion(degree) combining the visual passion with the back end practicality. Well, here goes something!
